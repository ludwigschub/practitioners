## Introductions: 

* VB: Founder of Women of Solid, Solid Team member, Co-chair of CG. First time here, listening to what Practitioners are up to and looking to have more communication/feedback into CG/specs.
* MdJ: Co-chair of CG. Was at first PRactitioners meetup. Working with a few people. Solid data modules to allow different apps to read/write data into pods. Solid Compound tries to make UX and DX easier. 

* FG: Quick question on Data modules, is that client-client?
* MdJ: Several modules. One for contacts, bookmarks, chat, tasks.. you can use it ??? or directly in an app so you know you'll be following client-client spec. 
* FG: Haven't seen those specs...
* JZ: There's WebID profile Type index, chat, SAI... all different repos. 
* VB: https://solidproject.org/TR
* JZ: ??? There will be a different set of modules we will need. One for social services is specific. 
* SU: Work with Kai and Frederick. Mainly in ??? industry. At Trinpod, we want to gather data from different souces, integrate from ??? 

## Announcements

* JZ: We talked about a meeting about search. FG will talk about Trinpod. Maxine will also talk. Someone from Communica as well. We'll talk about different approaches and then what our projects need. At that point we can draw use cases and requirements and have a jointmeeting with the CG and present what we found bottom-up. First meeting is for Feb 12th. Should we have an extra meeting on the 12th or push to regular schedule (19th)? 
* FG: Regular.
* DB: Regular.
* Mdj: Regular.
* JZ: Should we squeeze in one meeting or one for presenting and one to discuss, then third for CG?
* FG: Let's decide after the first.
* WP: Fine with either dates.

* TS: We're trying to figure out a way for people to share documents with govs/social services. 
* TS: What has worked weel: secure access, identity (no need to manage user accounts), data ownership (can self-host), privacy and permissions (granular, extensible), data sharing (sharing is easy, separation between person/agent/pod, "shared pod" is easy), data interoperability (semantic web techniques makes it easy to allow Solid app to interact with even non-Solid system that use semantic web techniques), notarization (loose data structure allows app to structure and store data). 
* TS: Issues: Private implementations by various servers. Inrupt's access request only works against ESS. We don't want to work against only one server. We are only testing against CSS at the moment. 
* TS: Hard to receive updates. Solid Notifications Protocol helps. Library support is limited. Inrupt's only works against ESS. CSS implements the protocol but no library. We're using all of Inrupt's libraries. We haven't found a library that works against CSS. Solid notifications only work against live connections. We can't ask what has changed since last visit/long time ago. Can't get a notification unless connected to pod, so cannot build an update feed. 
* TS: Pagination also an issue. Every request in Solid returns one result. LDP has Paging add on but optional, we haven't found a server implementation and no library. SPARQL provides support but not in the spec. 
* JZ: SPARQL is not specifically mentioned in Solid spec but works against RDF data in a pod. Communica has the ability to ??? server or client side. It can grab multiple documents and return them. Middle ground. 
* TS: As we understand it with Communica is still going to present as a single fetch but actually doing 700 requests... is that correct?
* JZ: Depends on the server. If it has a valid endpoint it will only pull the data it serves. If plain RDF file it will have to do the 700. You can build so it works in either case but efficient in only one. 
* TS: Good to know. We've been using Communica in some parts. 
* TS: Another issue: security model is complex. Lots of shared data, user could have a nefarious/buggy app giving control permissions or delete data. Clients cannot trust any data getting from a pod, need to validate. 
* TS: Workarounds: for access requests we have been sending plain text messages to public inbox, user reads and handles manually. We can also send but encode with commands for a certain app. We can also pick a specific server implementation and implement abstraction around it to allow to switch to whatever access request implementation we have in the future. We heck what the server supports and fit the app's functionality to that. 
* TS: Workaround for updates: we can try to have app wake up every few hours. We haven't tried implementing. We can store last state in a pod, go back later and diff. We can also subscribe to update list if the pod we want to subscribe has a subscription system, post message to our inbox when it is updated. 
* TS: For pagination SPARQL is a solution. Another solution is apps create index resource and store lists of related data. App maintains the list, additions, deletions, permissions. Sticking point is permissions. 
* TS: For security, Otto posted do & don't guide which helped. We haven't found a way to make security clear. We've discussed don't grant access to read a pod. Instead let them post request data to your inbox. User uses an app to process the request, manually approve, reject, modify... 
* TS: Comments or questions?
* FG: Seems ideally on most of the problems, if the servers supported those things it would make things easier. Trying to handle pagination on the app seems hard. Access grants, we plan to support that. What's great about these problems is that they can be ??? we have search coming up. Pagination is a big deal. Access grants we definitel need. Inrupt wrote a spec.
* TS: They have an implementation. 
* FG: From out perspective we'll support that.
* JZ: They don't have a spec, they documented how they did it, which is different from a spec other people cna follow. SAI is a spec and has a completely different way of handling. At some point we need to get into that question. As of right now, there are at least 3 different ways of handling granting access to application, none of them formalized or universally adopted.
* TS: I agree a lot of the work is figuring out what we can do with solid servers as they exist. All of these are things best addressed on the server. CSS is modular so you can extend. Unless we have a spec with a large set of features, we're going to need to have to work around / check what servers support. If apps can't identify features properly they'll go to lowest common denominator which will have performance issues.
* JZ: Imporant point that as servers differ they need to have a way to advertise features. For example, problem with what happens if you have triple-level security and that can't depend on document-level security.. if an app makes something private you can't count on it because maybe a triple was made public. Trinpod and other servers that aren't following a standard need a way to communicate. 
* Rui: Heard about notifications, but you didn't mention workarounds. 
* TS: Receiving updates.. Solid notifications is a way if actively connected. If not then store latest state or update list.
* Rui: Have you tried this way? Notifications not sent through notification channels, but instead just to inbox. Notification channel receives a ping saying there's content in the inbox. 
* TS: We can do that but you need a second app sending the notifications. 
* michal/mrkvon: Wondering if you have looked into webhook notification. Websocket you have to be connected, but webhooks you can make a server-side service with a Solid identity and if it has read access to the resource it an have a specific endpoint and Solid pod will send notifications back to this webhook. No connection needed. You can't observe wholepod but specific resources. If the service has write access it can write changes as they come. Not every Solid server supports webhooks. CSS does but needs to be enabled. NSS doesn't. If you need help feel free to ask. There's a specification: https://solid.github.io/notifications/webhook-channel-2023. 
* JZ: Rahul Gupta (CxRes) is proposing new notifications protocol. 
* MdJ: There are six different notification protocols. Would be cool to point webhook to inbox.
