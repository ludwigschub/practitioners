Developers do not have to use those shapes, but doing so will hopefully yield some interoperable apps. Some resources for working with Shapes are LDO. There's also SAI. Jackson will be available throughout the Hackathon to help with LDO, and will interview anyone using LDO afterwards for use in a paper to be submitted to ISWC 2024 Dates:
