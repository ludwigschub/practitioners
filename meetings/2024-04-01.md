## Searching/Indexing

Jackson 
  * talked with Espresso/Southhampton on search done by aggregating search hubs
  * dream search - search everything
  * this approach does not now depend on any Solid spec - it exists outside Solid
  * user-centric searching
  * scope defined by access controls
Pavlik
  * how does one defne the scope of the search
Erich
  * include spatial data searching
Fred
  * the search is done on the server using apache solr
  * would like API for server search
Pavlik
  * use cases are important
  * don't need technical details
  * do need to know where data stored single-pod, multi-pod and access controls
  * how many projects share cases
Michal
  * use type-indexes but it is painful
  * need broader, ld-fragments or other
Jackson
  * shift burden of search to searcher rather than storage provider
  * maintaining search on server is expensive
Fred
  * apache solr is open source, easy to maintain
Jackson
  * finding friends is the basic search
  * apache solr is expensive to maintain, would gravitate to ony big guys have servers
  * can do SPARQL searches without server endpoints
Pavlik
  * clients can run on servers and call server scripts
  * Liquid Chat works that way
Erich
  * finding what is available to search
  * use of void to index - https://www.w3.org/TR/void/
Jackson
  * private database and public database
  * notifications sent on changes, search is done on private database
## Homework for all projects
  * prepare a brief written description of your use case for search/indexing - don't concentrate on tech details rather desribe where the data is stored and what the access constraints on the searching you need.
