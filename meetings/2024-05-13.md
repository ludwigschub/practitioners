Each resource owner has multiple storage servers. Data is partitioned by different types which are shapes.

Navigation across social graph sould be easy, keeping in mind everyone can have multiple data resources.

Every user uses multiple devices and applications to work with their data.

Appart from users, there are bots that also interact with data.

A promise of Solid: we can choose the application that interacts with data. A user can authorise different apps to access the data.
